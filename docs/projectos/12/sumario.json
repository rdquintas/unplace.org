    "autorBio": "Sandra Gamarra Heshiki (b. Lima, Peru, 1972) is founder of LiMac, a fictitious museum project started in 2002 in response to the lack of contemporary museum in Lima. Since then, the museum appeared under divers forms such as souvenirs, stands, the production of works for its different collections, the organization of real and virtual exhibitions as well as a large database on www.li-mac.org.",
    "ano": "2014",
    "descricao": "For the Unplace exhibition, LiMac proposes “Solo Show”, an interactive museum room to be accessed on the internet. The visitor encounters itself within a 3 to 5 minutes guided visit but, because of the number of persons in the museums, he cannot see any of the art works. While the description of the guide accompanies the visitor, the room and its spectators become the center of attention.",
