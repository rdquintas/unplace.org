    "descricao": "The Other Side is a fictive online artwork employing image, icon and word to present a fluid unravelling of imagined cosmic migration – the inter-galactic journeying of belonging, un-belonging and longing. Inspired in part by the short online art scroller - Be Eaten http://www.mintarts.com/projects/BeEaten.html The Other Side will present an Afro futuristic exploration of the notion of diaspora. By distilling universal codifiers, themes, emblems, alphabets  and modes via drawing, charcoal scratching, word and tracing, The Other Side will present a coherent visual online scroll that is both otherworldly and yet strangely familiar.",
